kpis.py — all five signal calculations, as pure functions.

ONE FILE because these are five questions asked of ONE table (BTS r495-tyji), not
five independent analyses. Splitting them across five modules implied more
separation than exists: Signal 3 is literally Signal 1 + Signal 2 added together.

Everything here is PURE — rows in, dict out, no I/O and no printing. That is what
makes it testable (see selftest.py) and reusable: tools.py wraps these for the
model, and the web charts render the same numbers.

    Signal 1  congestion(rows)        how full are the flights, right now?
    Signal 2  growth(by_year(rows))   which direction, and how fast?
    Signal 3  score(b) / verdict(b)   which airport to pick? (reuses 1 + 2)
    Signal 4  mix(rows)               what KIND of passenger?
    Signal 5  national_rank(airport)  how big, nationally? (aggregated queries)

The four raw facts the whole model rests on: passengers, seats, departures, load
factor — plus a domestic split and an average trip distance.
