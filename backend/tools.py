tools.py — the five tools the model can activate, and their OpenAI schemas.

Each tool is a thin wrapper that turns a signal module into STRUCTURED data
(a dict), never printed text: the model reads these results, so they must be
small, self-describing, and honest about failure.

TWO EXPORTS the agent needs:
  TOOLS         name -> function, for dispatching what the model asked for
  TOOL_SCHEMAS  the routing menu sent to the model on every call

Add a signal by writing one wrapper + one schema() entry — nothing else changes.
